# Healthcare and Accident Insurance

XPrep is committed to provide the best lifestyle for its teams. We offer our employees a very good medical coverage and accident insurance with one of the major insurance companies in India. Both these benefits are managed by our auditors who will be visiting us every month.

We offer medical, dental and vision coverage. XPrep contributes 75% of the cost for all employee policies. Currently, there is no restriction on the company in which the insurance is being handled.
