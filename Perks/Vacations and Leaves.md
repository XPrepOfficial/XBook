### Vacation and Leaves

We understand that taking time off from work, and recharging yourself is very critical to do the most challenging work at XPrep. So you are free to take an off under these circumstances, in addition to the recognized list of holidays.

As a full-time team member of XPrep, you are free to take 3 weeks (15 days) of paid vacation every year that calculates to 1.25 of a day per month of work. But to make sure the business runs even during your vacation, you are required to schedule your vacation a week in advance, and get it approved from the founding team of XPrep. Once approved, we will communicate with the entire team.

Everyone also accrue **1 hour of sick leave for every 30 hours** of work, but cannot accrue more than 5 days of sick leave.

Team members should report vacation and sick days to the founder they report to, who will mark it in the payroll system (which keeps track of accrued days and should include them on every pay stub).

Team members with chronic or terminal illnesses should talk with the founder they report to about their needs for remote work, flexible time, disability leave and/or other support.

Being a small team, any unannounced leave will hurt the business of the company, which in turn goes against the growth of the company, and will not be tolerated.

#### Bereavement Leave

An employee who wishes to take time off due to the death of an immediate family member should notify the founder to whom they report. Paid bereavement leave will be granted up to three consecutive days for the death of a family member including the following:  spouse, domestic partner, cohabitant, child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, grandparent, great grandparent, brother or sister.
