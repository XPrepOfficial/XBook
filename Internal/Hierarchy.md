### Reporting Hierarchy

We believe in a flat hierarchy. But to split and handle operations, the CEO of the company takes the responsibility of the entire company. Everyone working at XPrep Engineering Team should report to Bikash Dash (CTO). Our goal of this particular relationship is to provide support and guidance to the team members. This goal is achieved by holding regular meetings, one-to-ones, reviews and much more. 

While we do not do any official performance reviews, we believe that one-to-ones will give us better idea about the targets that youâ€™ve achieved and other important aspects of your work at XPrep. Feedbacks about your performance are usually instant.

This one-step hierarchy is not meant to divide the company into teams or to highlight some kind of power. These are purely for responsibility and point of reference, in case of any problem that one might incur. Though everyone has a very distinctive business function, we all should try to operate as a single team as much as possible. At this point, XPrep has this one-step hierarchy, but we are trying to innovate even as we grow into a big company.
