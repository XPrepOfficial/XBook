# XBook
This document is open sourced by good souls of SKcript and accepted whole heartedly by XPrep team.

Everyday, we work on ideas that are highly complex and solve problems that are still a challenge to the entire industry. To do that kind of work, we understand the importance of having an open, inclusive and collaborative culture. Over the past few months, we’ve invested a lot of time in exploring and experimenting different areas where we could innovate in terms of creating the most effective company culture. 

While these things sounds good on paper, it is far more difficult to implement, and adopt a new cultural idea in the company. But for the ones who’re joining our company, we use something called the XBook, which gives them a glimpse of what they can expect and how the company works.
