You can work for a company. Or you can live for it. 

You can build a product. Or you can change the the world. 

You can code an application. Or make a difference.

There’s a job. And there’s a passion. The kind of passion that keeps you awake at night. The kind of passion that defies all barriers. The kind of passion that kindles the soul and reawakens the mind. The kind of passion that pricks the hair on your neck.

At XPrep we live that passion. And now you can too. 

Welcome.
