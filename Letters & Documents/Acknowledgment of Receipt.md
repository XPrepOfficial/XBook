### Acknowledgement of Receipt of Employee XBook

I hereby acknowledge that I have received the XPrep Employee Book and I confirm that I have read all the documents in the XBook to understand its provisions. I further understand that I can ask any clarification about any provisions I have to the founders of the company.

I further understand that the founders of XPrep may at any time modify, rescind, or revise any policy, benefit, or practice described in the XBook, and the same will be intimated to the entire company via email.

I understand and agree that my employment with XPrep is at-will and can be terminated by either me or the company without cause with one month notice, and that nothing in the XBook should be interpreted to the contrary. This is the entire agreement between me and XPrep on this subject; it supersedes any prior inconsistent representations or agreements and may only be modified in a writing signed by me and the CEO.

I acknowledge that it is my responsibility to read and become familiar with the contents of the XBook.
