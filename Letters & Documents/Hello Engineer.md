### Hello!

Welcome!

We are pleased to have you at XPrep, and we are excited to work with you on products that revolutionizes the industry. We are building a team that understands and aligns perfectly with our mission and core values, and invest their energy into marching in that direction. This XBook is to help you understand how we do business, the way we engage with the community and how we protect our identity. Your suggestions, comments, questions and contributions are welcome at all times to help improve the overall company culture and other things related to that.

Each and every team member is responsible for reading, understanding, and complying with this XBook. Our goal is to create a inclusive and open environment that will encourage you to innovate and think big all the time. We suggest you to be as constructive and supportive as possible to these compliances, that would propel your personal and professional growth.

We are a small company right now, and changes are rapid. While you will receive emails from the founders constantly about the updates to the policies and XBook, you are free to contribute by issuing a pull request here (https://github.com/XPrepOfficial/XBook).
